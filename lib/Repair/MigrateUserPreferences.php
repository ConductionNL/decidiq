/**
 * Decidiq Migrate User Preferences Repair Step
 *
 * Repair step that carries this app's per-user preferences across the
 * `decidesk` -> `decidiq` app-id rename.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM MigrateAppConfigKeys. `IAppConfig` and
 * `IConfig`'s user values are different stores: the former is `oc_appconfig`,
 * the latter `oc_preferences`. Both are namespaced by app id, so both are cut
 * off by the rename, but copying one does nothing for the other.
 *
 * WHY IT MATTERS MORE THAN IT LOOKS. Every read of a per-user preference in
 * this app carries a DEFAULT. `PreferencesController::getPreference()` reads
 * with `default: ''`, and the frontend then falls back to its shipped default
 * for anything absent. After the rename those lookups miss and the defaults
 * apply — so a member who turned a notification OFF starts receiving it again,
 * and a delegation window a user configured reads as unset. Nothing throws,
 * nothing is logged, and every page still renders. **A default-valued read
 * turns missing data into wrong behaviour rather than into an error**, which is
 * exactly why this is a migration and not a release note.
 *
 * WHY IT ENUMERATES BY USER-THEN-KEY, AND NEVER BY VALUE. `IConfig` offers
 * `getUsersForUserValue(app, key, value)`, which requires the caller to know
 * BOTH the key and the value up front. Neither is knowable here:
 *
 *   - The values are open-ended. Preferences hold delegation dates, delegate
 *     user ids and display choices, not a closed boolean set.
 *   - **The KEYS are open-ended too.** `PreferencesController` stores under
 *     `'pref_' . $safeKey`, where `$safeKey` is caller-supplied and sanitised
 *     only to `[a-z0-9-]{1,64}`. There is no finite key list to iterate, so a
 *     hardcoded `MIGRATED_KEYS` constant — the shape the pilot app used — would
 *     silently migrate an incomplete subset here while reporting success.
 *
 * This step therefore walks the users (`IUserManager::callForSeenUsers()`) and
 * asks `IConfig::getUserKeys()` for each one's actual stored keys under the old
 * app id. That is exhaustive by construction and cannot drift as new
 * preferences are added. `callForSeenUsers()` is the right walk rather than
 * `callForAllUsers()`: a user who has never logged in cannot have set a
 * preference, so the cheaper enumeration is also the complete one here.
 *
 * SAFETY. Idempotent and non-destructive, matching MigrateAppConfigKeys:
 *   - a value is copied only when the user has nothing stored under the new
 *     app id, so a preference changed after the rename is never clobbered and
 *     a second run is a no-op;
 *   - the old `decidesk` rows are never deleted, so a rollback still finds them;
 *   - every failure is logged and the walk continues, because one unreadable
 *     preference is not worth aborting an install over — and this step is
 *     registered under `<install>`, where a throwing repair step means the app
 *     never enables at all.
 *
 * Registered under BOTH `<install>` and `<post-migration>` in
 * `appinfo/info.xml` alongside MigrateAppConfigKeys — see the ordering comment
 * there.
