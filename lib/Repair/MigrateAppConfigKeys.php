/**
 * Decidiq Migrate App Config Keys Repair Step
 *
 * Repair step that carries this app's stored `IAppConfig` values across the
 * `decidesk` -> `decidiq` app-id rename.
 *
 * Nextcloud namespaces `IAppConfig` by app id at the storage layer
 * (`oc_appconfig.appid`), so renaming `<id>` does not rename the rows — it
 * makes every previously stored value unreachable, because the app now asks
 * for them under a different app id. There is no in-place app-id upgrade in
 * Nextcloud: the new id is simply a different app. This step therefore copies
 * each value from the old namespace to the new one.
 *
 * WHY THIS MATTERS PARTICULARLY HERE. `voter_token_secret` is the HMAC key
 * that signs voting tokens and mail-reply links. `InitializeSettings` GENERATES
 * a fresh one whenever it finds none — so without this step running FIRST, the
 * rename would orphan the old key, InitializeSettings would mint a new one, and
 * every outstanding vote link and mail-reply link in flight would stop
 * verifying. Nothing would throw: the tokens would simply fail their HMAC check
 * and read as invalid votes. That is why both steps are registered ahead of
 * InitializeSettings under BOTH `<install>` and `<post-migration>` in
 * `appinfo/info.xml`.
 *
 * WHY EVERY KEY RATHER THAN A FIXED LIST. `IAppConfig::getKeys()` is
 * exhaustive by construction and cannot drift out of date the way a hardcoded
 * list does. Past releases have written keys this app no longer reads, and the
 * admin settings surface writes whatever the settings map currently holds.
 *
 * SENSITIVITY IS CARRIED WITH THE VALUE. A sensitive value copied with a plain
 * `setValueString()` would land UNFLAGGED in the new namespace — printed in
 * cleartext by `occ config:list` and in every support dump that feeds. For
 * `voter_token_secret` that is a vote-forgery key in a support bundle, so the
 * flag is read from the old namespace and re-applied on the write.
 *
 * SAFETY. Idempotent and non-destructive:
 *   - a key is copied only when the old value is non-empty AND the new
 *     namespace does not already hold a value, so an admin edit made after the
 *     rename is never clobbered and a second run is a no-op;
 *   - the old `decidesk` rows are never deleted, so a rollback to the previous
 *     app id still finds its configuration intact;
 *   - values round-trip as raw strings. `IAppConfig` stores every value as a
 *     string and the typed accessors only coerce on read, so a string
 *     round-trip cannot lose or corrupt a value written by a typed setter;
 *   - every failure is logged and the loop continues. A repair step that
 *     throws aborts the install, and a config value that could not be copied
 *     is not worth failing an install over — the app falls back to its
 *     defaults and the admin can re-enter the setting.
