/**
 * Decidiq approval-route conclusion announcer.
 *
 * The ONE place a finished route becomes an `ApprovalRouteConcludedEvent`.
 * Three paths can decide a route's final stage — the cross-app action command,
 * this app's own REST surface, and a projected task answered from the inbox —
 * and before this class existed only the first announced. A producer that
 * delegated its runtime here would then have waited forever on a conclusion
 * that fired only when the final signature happened to arrive over the seam.
 *
 * It asks the ENGINE for the stages rather than querying them itself
 * (REQ-ARE-004: no second reader of route state), resolves the provenance pair
 * from the route the stages back-reference, and carries the full sign-off
 * record on the event so the producer can keep who-signed-what-when as case
 * data without reading this register back (ADR-022).
 *
 * A route with NO source app announces nothing: an internally instantiated
 * route has no producer waiting, and decisions set this precedent — an
 * internal decision emits no DecisionConcludedEvent either.
