/**
 * Decidiq mandate directory.
 *
 * Answers one question for the approval-route engine: may this actor sign a
 * stage on behalf of the person the stage names, under the mandate reference
 * they presented? The question was previously answered by nobody — dossiq's
 * ParafeerStepGuard accepted any non-empty mandate string and left the registry
 * check to "the future MandaatService", and decidiq recorded onBehalfOf and
 * mandate verbatim without reading either. A mandate check that exists only as
 * a recorded field is an open door: any authenticated user could sign someone
 * else's stage by typing a mandate reference.
 *
 * THE CHECK IS SCOPED TO WHAT THIS REGISTER CAN KNOW. A mandate reference that
 * resolves to a local `bevoegdheidstoedeling` row is judged on that row: it
 * must be effective, within its validity window, and name the acting delegate.
 * A reference that resolves to nothing is treated as an EXTERNAL mandate — the
 * producing app (dossiq's mandateringsbesluit register, for one) holds rows
 * this app cannot read without the cross-register reach ADR-022 forbids — and
 * is recorded verbatim, exactly as the approval-action schema always intended.
 * What is never accepted: a LOCAL row that is withdrawn, lapsed, out of window
 * or issued to somebody else. Resolvable-and-wrong is a refusal, not a shrug.
 *
 * REQ-DMR-006 BOUNDARY. delegatie-mandaatregister rules that the register is
 * assistive and SHALL NOT gate any *Decision* creation, transition or
 * enactment. An approval-route stage action is not a Decision lifecycle
 * transition — it is a sign-off by a named person, and verifying that a
 * delegate really holds the mandate they wave is the one thing a sign-off
 * chain exists to do. The prohibition and this check do not overlap.
