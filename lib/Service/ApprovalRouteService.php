/**
 * Decidiq approval-route engine.
 *
 * Turns an `ApprovalRoute` template into `DecisionStage` rows against a subject,
 * and advances them as `ApprovalAction`s arrive.
 *
 * WHY THIS CLASS EXISTS. `DecisionStage` modelled the stages of a route and
 * NOTHING in this app ever wrote one — six seeded rows, two readers, and a route
 * tab whose own header says it is read-only. A schema without an engine is a
 * description of a capability, not the capability.
 *
 * THE ENGINE IS FAIL-CLOSED. An action by an actor the active stage does not
 * name is refused; a skip of a mandatory stage is refused; a return that points
 * forwards is refused. A sign-off route is only worth anything if the sequence
 * is enforced, and a guard whose result the caller may ignore is not a guard.
 *
 * THE PARAFERING RUNTIME LIVES HERE NOW (parafering-route-runtime). dossiq's
 * pipeline owned four things this engine did not: a stage-typed action
 * vocabulary, mandated delegate signing, a return that goes back to the sender
 * rather than to an earlier step, and steps that run in parallel. All four are
 * absorbed below, so dossiq can retire its route advancement the way it retired
 * decision authoring — raise, wait for the conclusion, record.
