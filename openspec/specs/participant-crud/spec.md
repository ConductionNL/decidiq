# participant-crud Specification

## Purpose
Provides list, detail, create, edit, and delete operations for decision-maker records, with full-text search and role filtering. New decision makers are created as Popolo Person plus Membership pairs, while the legacy flat Participant schema is retained as a deprecated backward-compatibility shim so existing records, quorum aggregation, and vote-casting continue to function.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Participant list view
The app SHALL display all Participant objects in a paginated, searchable list using `CnIndexPage` with `useListView`.

@e2e exclude basic list rendering is exercised by tests/e2e/spec-coverage/participants-page.spec.ts ("Participants: index renders heading, object-list table and Add CTA"), but that test is tagged to a `participant-management` spec path (which does not exist under `openspec/specs/`) rather than this spec, and does not drive the search input or the role `CnFilterBar` — no e2e file carries an @e2e tag for these exact scenario ids; the search and filter halves are untested entirely.

#### Scenario: User views participant list
- **WHEN** the user navigates to `/participants`
- **THEN** a list of Participant objects is shown with columns for displayName, role, party, and email

#### Scenario: User searches participants
- **WHEN** the user types in the search input on the participants list
- **THEN** the list filters via OpenRegister full-text search on displayName, role, and party

#### Scenario: User filters by role
- **WHEN** the user applies a role filter via `CnFilterBar`
- **THEN** only Participants with the selected role (chair, member, secretary, etc.) are shown

### Requirement: Create a participant
The app SHALL allow users to create a new decision maker as a `Person` + `Membership`
pair via the Popolo model (per the `person-and-membership` spec). Creating a new flat
`Participant` object is deprecated: the `Participant` schema is retained only as a
backward-compatibility shim and SHALL NOT be the default target for new decision-maker
data. Existing `Participant` records remain readable and editable.
<!-- Previous behavior: the app created a new Participant object via a schema-driven form
     dialog with displayName/role/party/email/joinedAt/leftAt/votingWeight, persisted via
     ObjectService.saveObject(). That flat model is deprecated in favour of Person + Membership. -->

#### Scenario: New decision maker created as Person + Membership
- **GIVEN** the user adds a new decision maker
- **WHEN** the record is created
- **THEN** a `Person` (identity) and a `Membership` (role/party/votingWeight/body link) are persisted via `ObjectService.saveObject()`, not a flat Participant

@e2e exclude the live `/participants` page's create dialog is still titled "Create Participant" and creates a flat Participant object (see tests/e2e/spec-coverage/participants-page.spec.ts's "Add Participant opens a real create form dialog" test) — the Person+Membership creation UI this scenario describes does not appear to be wired into that page yet; genuine coverage gap tracked as e2e debt rather than claimed coverage.

#### Scenario: Participant creation path is deprecated
- **WHEN** new decision-maker data is seeded or created by this change
- **THEN** it is NOT created as a `Participant` object (the shim is retained for existing records only)

@e2e exclude seed-data/schema-shape assertion — no UI surface distinct from the scenario above; checkable by inspecting the register's seed data directly.

#### Scenario: Validation prevents save without required fields
- **WHEN** the user submits the Person/Membership form with `name` (Person) or `role` (Membership) empty
- **THEN** the form displays a validation error and the objects are not saved

@e2e exclude depends on the same not-yet-wired Person+Membership create UI as the "New decision maker created as Person + Membership" scenario above; genuine coverage gap tracked as e2e debt.

### Requirement: View participant detail
The app SHALL display a detail view for a single Participant showing all their properties.

@e2e exclude no current e2e test clicks a participant row and asserts the detail page (route, GovernanceBody relation card, or CnObjectSidebar); tests/e2e/spec-coverage/participants-page.spec.ts covers only the list page — genuine coverage gap tracked as e2e debt.

#### Scenario: User opens a participant detail page
- **WHEN** the user clicks a row in the participants list
- **THEN** the router navigates to `/participants/:id` and `CnDetailPage` renders the participant's properties

#### Scenario: GovernanceBody relation shown in detail
- **WHEN** the participant detail page loads
- **THEN** a `CnDetailCard` section displays the linked GovernanceBody name and type if a relation exists

#### Scenario: CnObjectSidebar is available
- **WHEN** the user is on the participant detail page
- **THEN** `CnObjectSidebar` is rendered with Files, Notes, Tags, Tasks, and Audit Trail tabs

### Requirement: Edit a participant
The app SHALL allow users to edit an existing Participant object.

@e2e exclude no current e2e test opens the Edit dialog on a Participant or asserts a persisted change; genuine coverage gap tracked as e2e debt.

#### Scenario: User edits a participant
- **WHEN** the user clicks the Edit button on the participant detail page
- **THEN** a `CnFormDialog` opens pre-populated with the current participant data

#### Scenario: Changes are persisted
- **WHEN** the user modifies fields and clicks save
- **THEN** the Participant is updated via `ObjectService.saveObject()` and the detail view reflects the new values

### Requirement: Delete a participant
The app SHALL allow users to delete a Participant object with confirmation.

@e2e exclude no current e2e test drives the delete (or delete-cancel) flow for a Participant; genuine coverage gap tracked as e2e debt.

#### Scenario: User deletes a participant
- **WHEN** the user clicks Delete and confirms in `CnDeleteDialog`
- **THEN** the Participant is removed via `ObjectService.deleteObject()` and the user is redirected to the participants list

#### Scenario: Delete is cancelled
- **WHEN** the user cancels the delete dialog
- **THEN** the Participant is not deleted and the detail page remains

### Requirement: REQ-PCR-010 — Participant schema deprecated in favour of Person + Membership

The system MUST annotate the `Participant` schema in
`lib/Settings/decidesk_register.json` as deprecated (in its `description`), and MUST NOT
create new decision-maker seed data as `Participant` objects. New person/relationship
data MUST be modelled as `Person` + `Membership` per the `person-and-membership` spec.
The `Participant` schema MUST remain active (not deleted) so existing references —
the `Meeting` quorum aggregation (`totalParticipantCount`/`presentParticipantCount`),
`VotingService::resolveParticipantUuid()`, `Vote.participant`, `EngagementRecord.participant`,
and dependent specs — continue to function. As of this change, `ConflictOfInterest.boardMember`
and `ProxyAuthorization.grantor`/`holder` no longer `$ref: Participant` (retargeted to
`Membership`/`Person` respectively — REQ-SDM-023/024); the schema's own description MUST
name the narrowed, exact set of remaining `$ref: Participant` consumers rather than describe
the shim's reach in general terms, so a future reader does not have to re-derive the current
consumer set by grepping the register.

@e2e exclude schema/register-shape assertions (the `Participant` schema's `description` text and the shim's continued queryability) — no UI surface; checkable directly by reading `lib/Settings/decidesk_register.json`'s `Participant.description`. All four scenarios under this requirement are of this kind.

#### Scenario: Participant marked deprecated
- GIVEN the decidesk register is imported
- WHEN the `Participant` schema description is inspected
- THEN it states the schema is deprecated and that Person + Membership is the canonical model

#### Scenario: New data uses Person + Membership
- GIVEN a new decision maker is seeded by this change
- WHEN the seeds are imported
- THEN the person is created as a `Person` + `Membership` pair, not a new `Participant`

#### Scenario: Participant shim still resolvable
- GIVEN existing code reads Participant records for quorum and vote-casting
- WHEN those reads execute after this change
- THEN the `Participant` schema is still present and queryable (the shim is retained)

#### Scenario: Participant's description names its exact remaining consumers

- **GIVEN** the decidesk register is imported after this change
- **WHEN** the `Participant` schema description is inspected
- **THEN** it names exactly `Vote.participant`, `EngagementRecord.participant`, the `Meeting` quorum
  aggregation, and `VotingService::resolveParticipantUuid()` as the remaining shim consumers
- **AND** it no longer implies `ConflictOfInterest` or `ProxyAuthorization` still reference it
