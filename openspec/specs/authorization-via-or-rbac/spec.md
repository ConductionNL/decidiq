# authorization-via-or-rbac Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change consume-or-rbac-authorization. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: REQ-RBAC-001 Governance-body roles project into OpenRegister RBAC scopes
decidiq SHALL maintain, per GovernanceBody, two OpenRegister RBAC scopes derived from the body's
member roles: a **chair scope** (`decidesk:body:{bodyId}:chair`) containing members whose role is
`chair` or `chairman`, and a **signatory scope** (`decidesk:body:{bodyId}:signatory`) containing
members whose role is `chair`, `chairman`, `vice-chairman`, or `secretary`. A role-projection hook
SHALL reconcile both scopes to the body's current roster whenever a member (Participant/Membership)
of that body is created, updated, or removed. Reconciliation SHALL be idempotent and SHALL fail
closed (an unresolved or empty scope denies rather than over-grants).

#### Scenario: Adding a chair populates both scopes
- **GIVEN** a GovernanceBody with no chair
- **WHEN** a member of that body is given the role `chair`
- **THEN** that member is present in both `decidesk:body:{bodyId}:chair` and
  `decidesk:body:{bodyId}:signatory`.

@e2e exclude backend role→scope projection with no distinct UI flow; the scope-group membership is maintained by GovernanceRoleScopeProjector on a roster write and is unit-proven in GovernanceRoleScopeProjectorTest (chair→both scopes).

#### Scenario: Secretary is a signatory but not a chair
- **GIVEN** a GovernanceBody
- **WHEN** a member is given the role `secretary`
- **THEN** that member is present in `decidesk:body:{bodyId}:signatory`
- **AND** that member is NOT present in `decidesk:body:{bodyId}:chair`.

@e2e exclude backend projection set-membership assertion with no distinct UI flow; unit-proven in GovernanceRoleScopeProjectorTest (secretary→signatory-only).

#### Scenario: Removing a role reconciles the scopes idempotently
- **GIVEN** a member currently in a body's chair scope
- **WHEN** that member's chair role is removed and the projection runs (or re-runs)
- **THEN** the member is absent from both scopes
- **AND** re-running the projection produces no further change.

@e2e exclude backend idempotent-reconcile invariant with no distinct UI flow; unit-proven in GovernanceRoleScopeProjectorTest (removal reconciles + re-run is a no-op).

### Requirement: REQ-RBAC-002 Signatory authorization is an OpenRegister RBAC rule, not an app-local service
Initiating a qualified e-signature (QES) on a Minutes record (and on a resolution `decision`) SHALL
be authorized by an OpenRegister property-RBAC rule that write-gates the signing-request property to
the owning body's `signatory` scope. The app-local `MinutesAuthorizationService` SHALL be removed and
SHALL NOT be reintroduced; the signing controller SHALL rely on OpenRegister returning a
403/`null` for a non-signatory. No app-local `*AuthorizationService` or `*PermissionService` for
decidiq OpenRegister objects SHALL remain.

#### Scenario: A signatory may initiate signing
- **GIVEN** a Minutes record on a body and a user in that body's `signatory` scope
- **WHEN** the user initiates QES signing
- **THEN** OpenRegister authorizes the signing-request write and the signing flow starts.

#### Scenario: A non-signatory is denied by OpenRegister
- **GIVEN** a Minutes record on a body and a user NOT in that body's `signatory` scope
- **WHEN** the user attempts to initiate QES signing
- **THEN** OpenRegister denies the signing-request write (403)
- **AND** no app-local authorization service is consulted.

#### Scenario: The anti-pattern gate is clean
- **GIVEN** the decidiq worktree after this change
- **WHEN** `lint-or-abstraction-anti-patterns.sh` runs
- **THEN** it reports no `consume-or-rbac-fleet-wide` finding for decidiq.

@e2e exclude build-time lint-gate assertion, not a runtime UI flow; verified by running lint-or-abstraction-anti-patterns.sh (reports clean; no *AuthorizationService/*PermissionService remains under lib/).

### Requirement: REQ-RBAC-003 Chair-only lifecycle transitions are enforced by OpenRegister property RBAC
Chair-only meeting-lifecycle transitions SHALL be enforced by an OpenRegister property-RBAC rule that
write-gates the `meeting.lifecycle` property to the owning body's `chair` scope for the transitions
listed in the workflow template's `chairOnlyTransitions`. The imperative
`WorkflowService::requiresChairAuthorization()` actor-branch and the NC-UID-vs-chair comparison in
`MeetingService` SHALL be removed. The workflow **policy** predicates (domain `allowPause` /
`allowAdjourn` flags, `isQuorumRequired`) and the quorum data-predicate
(`DecisionTransitionGuard::isOpenAllowed`) SHALL remain, as they express process configuration and
data state, not actor authorization.

#### Scenario: Only the chair may run a chair-only transition
- **GIVEN** a meeting whose `from:to` transition is in `chairOnlyTransitions`
- **WHEN** a user NOT in the body's `chair` scope attempts the transition
- **THEN** OpenRegister denies the `meeting.lifecycle` write (403)
- **AND WHEN** the body's chair attempts the same transition
- **THEN** OpenRegister authorizes it and the lifecycle advances.

#### Scenario: Domain policy still forbids a disallowed transition regardless of actor
- **GIVEN** a domain whose workflow sets `allowPause: false`
- **WHEN** the body's chair attempts `opened → paused`
- **THEN** the transition is refused by the workflow policy (not permitted in this domain)
- **AND** the refusal is independent of the actor's scope membership.

### Requirement: REQ-RBAC-004 The duplicated admin guards consume OpenRegister's admin determination
decidiq SHALL replace the four per-controller `requireAdmin()` copies
(`GovernanceReportController`, `MultilingualReconciliationController`, `AuditLogController`,
`RegulatorExportController`) with a single shared admin guard that consumes OpenRegister's admin
determination (`PropertyRbacHandler::isAdmin()` / the OpenRegister authorization decision). Each
controller SHALL call the shared guard; a non-admin SHALL receive 403 on every previously
admin-gated method.

#### Scenario: A non-admin is denied on every previously admin-gated surface
- **GIVEN** a non-admin user
- **WHEN** the user calls any method previously guarded by a private `requireAdmin()`
- **THEN** the shared guard returns 403
- **AND** there is exactly one admin-guard implementation shared across the four controllers.

#### Scenario: An admin is allowed
- **GIVEN** an admin user
- **WHEN** the user calls a previously admin-gated method
- **THEN** the shared guard permits the call.

### Requirement: REQ-RBAC-005 Fail-closed authorization is preserved end to end
Every migrated authorization path SHALL deny on ambiguity — an unresolved scope, a missing body, or
an OpenRegister error SHALL result in no write (403/`null`), never a silent skip. The change SHALL
NOT introduce a `catch (\Throwable) { return null; }` resolver whose null return is treated by a
caller as "check skipped".

#### Scenario: An unresolved scope denies
- **GIVEN** a signing or chair-only transition attempt whose body scope cannot be resolved
- **WHEN** OpenRegister evaluates the RBAC rule
- **THEN** the write is denied (403)
- **AND** the attempt is never treated as authorized.

@e2e exclude fail-closed edge (unresolvable body scope) with no distinct UI flow; unit-proven in GovernanceScopeGuardTest (fails closed when the body is unresolvable / on OR error) and MeetingServiceTest (chair-only transition denied when the governanceBody cannot be resolved).


### Requirement: REQ-RBAC-006 The register declares an authorization baseline so an absent block cannot grant writes
The `decidesk` register row SHALL declare an `authorization` block naming EVERY canonical
OpenRegister action (`read`, `list`, `create`, `update`, `delete`). `read`, `list` and `create`
SHALL be granted to `authenticated`; `update` and `delete` SHALL NOT be, so that a user who is
neither the object's owner, nor a Nextcloud admin, nor a member of the named administrator group
cannot rewrite or destroy another user's decidiq object through OpenRegister's own
`/apps/openregister/api/objects/decidiq/<schema>` API. Schemas that declare their own
`authorization` block SHALL keep it — OpenRegister resolves the schema block first and falls back to
the register's only when a schema has none — and those blocks SHALL continue to name read actions
only. The register version, the configuration version and the app version SHALL all be bumped in the
same change, because the register import skips on a non-newer version with no content fallback and
the `<post-migration>` repair step that performs the import runs only on `occ upgrade`.

#### Scenario: A non-owner cannot rewrite another user's object
- **GIVEN** a Decision created by user A, and user B who is not an admin and not in the
  administrator group
- **WHEN** user B issues an update or delete against that Decision through OpenRegister's object API
- **THEN** OpenRegister denies the write
- **AND WHEN** user A issues the same write on their own object
- **THEN** OpenRegister permits it via the unconditional owner bypass.

#### Scenario: Reads and creates are unchanged
- **GIVEN** any authenticated user
- **WHEN** the user lists or reads decidiq objects, or creates a new one
- **THEN** the action is permitted exactly as before the baseline was declared.

#### Scenario: The baseline names every action
- **GIVEN** the shipped register row
- **WHEN** its `authorization` block is read
- **THEN** every canonical action is named with a non-empty rule list, because OpenRegister denies
  any action a non-empty block omits — an unnamed action would break the app rather than secure it.

@e2e exclude The assertion is a per-user DENIAL by OpenRegister's own permission evaluator against a declaration this repo ships, and the owner bypass is unconditional and SQL-side — so a browser test driven by a single seeded (and therefore owning, usually admin) session cannot observe it at all, and would report success over the exact hole. Pinned by `tests/Unit/RegisterAuthorizationTest.php` on the declaration side; the per-user behaviour needs a two-account probe against a live instance, recorded in the PR as verification owed rather than claimed.
