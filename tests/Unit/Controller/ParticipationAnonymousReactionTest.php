/**
 * Contract tests for
 * `POST /api/participation/public/consultations/{consultationId}/reactions`.
 *
 * This is the ONE `#[PublicPage]` write in the app: an unauthenticated citizen
 * posting a reaction to a consultation. Everything about its contract is
 * therefore load-bearing in a way an authenticated endpoint's is not.
 *
 * Three properties are pinned here.
 *
 * 1. The submitter is NEVER taken from the request. The service is called with
 *    `ncUid: null` and a `clientSeed` derived server-side from the remote
 *    address; the pseudonymous token is built from that. A version that read a
 *    submitter from the body would let an anonymous caller attribute a reaction
 *    to a named citizen, and would pass every status assertion.
 *
 * 2. "Anonymous reactions are not enabled for this consultation" answers 401,
 *    not 403 or 422, and is THROTTLED. It is the one rejection that tells an
 *    anonymous prober something about a consultation's configuration, so it has
 *    to be rate-limited like a failed login rather than returned freely.
 *
 * 3. Every other rejection stays coarse: a malformed body is 400, anything else
 *    is 409. No branch leaks whether the consultation exists.
 *
