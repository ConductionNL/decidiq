/**
 * `BudgetVotingService::castAdvisoryVote()` refuses when the round cannot be
 * established, and still accepts when it is genuinely open.
 *
 * The window check used to live inside `if ($budgetId !== null) { if
 * ($roundEntity !== null) { ... } }`, so the only code that could say "voting is
 * closed" did not run at all for a proposal whose `ParticipatoryBudget` could
 * not be resolved — a missing relation, or a round row deleted after the
 * proposal was made. Votes were accepted indefinitely, past `votingDeadline`,
 * on a healthy 201.
 *
 * Both directions are pinned, because a guard proven only in the refusing
 * direction would be satisfied by a service that refuses everything:
 *   - two fail-closed shapes REJECT and never reach the tally;
 *   - an open round still TALLIES.
