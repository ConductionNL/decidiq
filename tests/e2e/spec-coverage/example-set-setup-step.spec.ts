 * ADR-042 / ADR-111 — the example-set setup steps, against a running instance.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The programme that added demo data to this fleet shipped a
 * defect that every unit test passed: the import printed `register "…"
 * imported.` and seeded ZERO of the descriptor's objects. The unit tests could
 * not see it — they mock the import service, so they validate the CALL and
 * never its effect.
 *
 * So the assertion that matters here is not "the endpoint answers 200". It is
 * that the response NAMES WHAT LANDED. A success message that cannot be told
 * apart from an import that wrote nothing is exactly what let that defect
 * through.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED. Installing this app used to plant 334 objects nobody asked
 * for: every register.d fragment carried its own seedData and the configuration
 * import merged all of them. The objects now live in `lib/Settings/profiles/`,
 * one file per example set, and a bare install plants nothing. The wizard asks
 * WHICH set, then loads it — two steps rather than one, because
 * `CnSetupWizard::runAction()` posts no body and so cannot carry the answer.
 *
 * WHY THE API AND NOT A CLICK-THROUGH. `CnAppRoot` opens the optional wizard
 * only while an optional step is outstanding, and the CI seed deliberately
 * settles those so the wizard stops covering the app in every test. The
 * observable surface for this capability is therefore the contract the wizard
 * calls — `GET /api/setup/status`, `POST /api/setup/config` and
 * `POST /api/setup/action/{id}` — issued from inside the authenticated admin
 * page so every call carries the real session and `OC.requestToken` through
 * Nextcloud's `AuthorizedAdminSetting` middleware. A unit test with a mocked
 * IAppConfig cannot show that middleware admitting the request; this can.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ASSERT. That an example-set step comes FIRST
 * is a property of the manifest, which the app bundles rather than serves, so
 * it is not observable from here; a static gate checks it on every change.
 * That importing a set leaves the register row untouched is likewise invisible
 * from the browser: it is a property of the descriptor shape (no
 * `components.registers`), asserted in RegisterJsonTest and verified against a
 * live instance when the shape was chosen.
 *
 * @spec exclude ADR-042/ADR-111 setup contract; no per-app behavioural spec.
