 * Gate-19 e2e coverage — app configuration (genuine behavioural).
 *
 * RETARGETED under ADR-079 D1. This file used to deep-link the in-app
 * `/apps/decidiq/settings` route — the manifest `type:"settings"` page — which
 * was a SECOND home for configuration that already lived in the Nextcloud
 * settings framework. That page is deleted; app-level configuration now has
 * exactly one address, `/settings/admin/decidiq`, rendered by
 * lib/Settings/AdminSettings.php and authorized by Nextcloud SERVER-SIDE before
 * the section renders.
 *
 * The scenarios below are the same two the old file owned; only the surface
 * moved. Two things got stronger in the move, and neither is a relaxation:
 *
 *  - The old file carried a `test.fixme` for the register-mapping actions,
 *    because the nc-vue `version-info` / `register-mapping` settings WIDGETS
 *    crashed while rendering the manifest page (`TypeError: e is not a
 *    function` at `Proxy.render`, twice). The admin page does not use those
 *    widgets — CnAdminSettingsShell renders the register mapping itself — so
 *    the scenario is asserted here for real instead of being deferred.
 *  - The old file could not assert on decidiq-origin console errors, for the
 *    same reason. This one can.

// organisatie_modus was the ONE key the deleted in-app page owned that the
// admin page did not — the other two Advanced fields (ori_endpoint,
// email_voting_enabled) already had sections here. This test is what makes the
// rehoming real rather than asserted: it selects a mode, saves, and requires
// the choice to have reached a consumer on the other side of the server.
//
// The anchor above used to name the REQUIREMENT slug
// (`requirement-req-adm-mode-001-...`). gate-19 indexes SCENARIO slugs, so that
// anchor resolved to nothing and was reported by nobody — a dangling anchor is
// silent, which is why it survived. It now names the scenario this body
// actually exercises.
//
// And the body was extended to cover all three of that scenario's THEN clauses
// rather than two. It used to re-read the admin form it had just written, which
// proves the form round-trips and nothing else; the third clause — "the
// navigation Bodies item relabels on next render" — went unasserted, and a mode
// setting that persists while changing nothing a user sees is the whole failure
// this scenario guards against. src/config/modeLabels.js maps Bodies to
// "Factions & bodies" under gov and "Factions & committees" under assoc, so
// reading the label in the SPA proves persistence AND the relabel in one
// navigation. Mutating that map to any other string fails this test and no
// other, which is the control that makes the anchor honest.

	// Two nc-vue specifics, both already documented by passing tests in

	//
	//  - NcSelect does NOT set `inheritAttrs: false`, so `data-testid` lands on
	//    the WRAPPER, not the combobox. Clicking the wrapper does not open the
	//    dropdown; click the inner input.
	//  - Options render through NcEllipsisedOption, which splits any label of
	//    10+ characters into two spans, so the option's ACCESSIBLE NAME gains a
	//    space at the split point — an option named "Association (assoc)" never
	//    exists. Match on text content instead, which is unaffected.
	await section.locator('[data-testid="organisation-mode"] input').first().click()
	// CORPORATE, not Association. `assoc` no longer relabels anything: under
	// configurable-types-domain-model REQ-CTM-010 ("one concept, one label")
	// MODE_LABELS.gov and MODE_LABELS.assoc are now the SAME map —
	// `Organisation: 'Bodies'` in both — because 'Factions & bodies' implied two
	// kinds of thing where a faction is just a GovernanceBody with
	// bodyType 'faction'. Switching gov → assoc is therefore invisible in the

	// resolves nav labels through src/config/modeLabels.js: the Organisation
	// entry is 'Bodies' under gov and 'Board' under corp. So this single
	// navigation covers the scenario's remaining two THEN clauses — the value
	// persisted server-side, and the navigation relabelled.
	//
	// ⚠️ Two page loads, not three. This app awaits initializeStores() BEFORE
	// createApp().mount(), so every navigation blocks on a settings round trip;
	// an earlier draft re-read the admin page here as well and spent the whole
	// 20 s per-test budget on redundant SPA boots. The fix is to remove a
	// navigation, never to widen the timeout.
