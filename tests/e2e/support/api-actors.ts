 * Request contexts that act as ONE named Nextcloud identity each, for specs
 * that prove API and permission scenarios rather than drive the SPA.
 *
 * Why not the project's admin `storageState`
 * -------------------------------------------
 * The project context carries the admin session cookie. A superuser bypasses
 * OpenRegister's object RBAC and property RBAC, so a scenario that says "a
 * citizen may", "an anonymous visitor may not" or "staff may" cannot be told
 * apart from "there is no rule" when every call is made as admin. Each context
 * built here starts from an EMPTY storage state and carries exactly one
 * identity: HTTP Basic for a named account, nothing at all for anonymous.
 *
 * Why every context sends `OCS-APIRequest: true`
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * Nextcloud's `Request::passesCSRFCheck()` accepts a request carrying that
 * header without a `requesttoken`. The app's participation endpoints are not
 * `#[NoCSRFRequired]`, and a Basic-auth response sets a session cookie, so the
 * second write in the same context would otherwise need a CSRF token. With the
 * header set, a refusal can only come from the code under test.
 *
 * Why `send: 'always'`
 * --------------------
 * Playwright withholds Basic credentials until it sees a `WWW-Authenticate`
 * challenge. The OpenRegister object API and decidiq's app routes answer
 * anonymously readable requests without one, so without `send: 'always'` the
 * call silently runs as the anonymous principal.
 *
 * Accounts are created per run over OCS with a CSPRNG password and deleted in
 * `afterAll`. Objects are tracked in an `ObjectLedger` by the id the response
 * returned, and deleted children-first by `ObjectLedger.cleanup()`, which a
 * spec calls from `afterAll` so a failed assertion still cleans up.
