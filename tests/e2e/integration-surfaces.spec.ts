 * The per-object INTEGRATION SURFACE for a motion, driven in a browser.
 *
 * It is a routed, manifest-declared `type: "custom"` page whose whole job is to
 * mount `CnDetailPage` with `sidebar.useRegistry: true` for one object type
 * (ADR-019). Until this spec existed, nothing in the suite asserted it.
 *
 * `integration-registry.spec.ts` navigates to one of these routes, but every
 * assertion it makes is about the shared registry sidebar — the counts and tab
 * ids that CnObjectSidebar renders. Not one of them touches the page component
 * itself, so the view could render an empty shell and that spec would still be
 * green. This one asserts the page's OWN markup: the body block the view
 * declares and the back-link it wires to its detail route.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE OTHER THREE INTEGRATION ROUTES ARE NOT COVERED HERE, AND THEIR
 * COMPONENT NAMES ARE DELIBERATELY NOT WRITTEN ANYWHERE IN THIS FILE. gate-26
 * matches a page component to its coverage on the bare PascalCase token, so an
 * earlier draft of this header — which listed all four paths purely as
 * documentation — was enough to turn the gate GREEN for three screens no test
 * touches. Measured: with this file present the gate reported PASS; with it
 * moved aside, `FAIL — 4`. A comment must never be able to close a coverage
 * finding, so the names stay out.
 *
 * READ-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION
 * -------------------------
 * This spec issues GETs and navigations only — it creates and deletes nothing.
 * The objects it drives are the ones `tests/e2e/ci-seed.sh` provisions and
 * verifies (≥2 meetings, ≥3 agenda-items, ≥3 decisions), so on CI the data is
 * guaranteed to be there. When it is not, the resolver fails LOUDLY rather than
 * skipping: a surface that was never opened must not report as a pass.

// ONE SURFACE, BECAUSE ONE SURFACE IS WHAT I CAN SHOW WORKS.
//
// This spec started with all four integration routes. I was wrong about the
// other three, twice, spending a CI run on each guess:
//
//   1. "those views never render" -> flipped three manifest pages from
//      `type: "detail"` to `type: "custom"` and registered a missing import.
//      CI: byte-identical failures. Reverted.
//   2. "`config.widgets` is the discriminator, so assert the widget grid
//      instead" -> CI: still failed, AND a page-heading assertion added along
//      the way broke the one test that had been passing. Reverted.
//
// What CI has actually PROVEN, twice, is narrow: the motion route mounts its own
// component, and its body block and back-link testids are present. The meeting,
// decision and agenda-item routes do not produce their testids, and I do not yet
// know what they render instead. `config.widgets` correlates — but correlation
// is precisely what misled me in round 2, and the local dev container serves a
// bundle weeks older than development, so it cannot settle it either.
//
// The other three are therefore LEFT UNCOVERED ON PURPOSE, and gate-26 must go
// on reporting them. Note how easily that could have been faked: this gate
// matches a component to its coverage on the bare PascalCase token, so merely
// NAMING those three files in a comment — as an earlier draft of this note did —
// turned the gate green with no test behind it. The names are spelled out
// nowhere in this file for that reason. Three view files that nothing appears to
// mount need a decision (delete as dead code, or establish what serves those
// routes), not a fourth guess dressed up as a test.
