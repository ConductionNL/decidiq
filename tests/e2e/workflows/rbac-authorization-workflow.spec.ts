 * DEEP, data-dependent e2e — the consume-or-rbac-authorization migration
 * driven through the real SPA UI + object API. It proves the who-may-act
 * outcomes preserved by the migration are STILL enforced, now via OpenRegister
 * RBAC scopes projected from the governance-body roster:
 *
 *   - a signatory (chair/vice-chair/secretary of the body) may initiate QES
 *     signing on a Minutes record; a non-signatory is denied (403);
 *   - only a member of the body's chair scope may run a chair-only meeting
 *     lifecycle transition; a non-chair is denied;
 *   - a disallowed domain transition is still refused by workflow policy,
 *     independent of the actor's scope;
 *   - a non-admin is denied on every previously `requireAdmin()`-gated
 *     controller surface; an admin is allowed.
 *
 * LIVE-RUN STATUS. The admin-gating scenario RUNS: it drives the four
 * RequiresOrAdmin controllers over HTTP as an anonymous caller (401), as the
 * non-admin account ci-seed.sh provisions (403), and as the admin session
 * Playwright holds (not denied).
 *
 * The three scope-dependent scenarios still skip, and the reason has been
 * corrected. It used to read "decidiq not deployed on the shared instance",
 * which stopped being true long ago — decidiq is deployed, and 205 other tests
 * drive it on the same run. What actually blocks them is narrower: each needs a
 * SECOND account to act, and each acts through a POST, which Nextcloud answers
 * 412 unless the request carries a CSRF requesttoken from that account's own
 * session. This suite ships a single storageState (admin) and no helper to sign
 * in as anybody else, so the denial half cannot be staged. Each is covered at
 * unit level (GovernanceScopeGuardTest, GovernanceRoleScopeProjectorTest,
 * MeetingServiceTest chair-scope allow/deny + fail-closed,
 * EIDASSignatureControllerTest signatory allow/deny).
 *
 * 🔑 The old reason was not merely stale, it was load-bearing: while it stood,
 * nobody re-read the endpoint list underneath it, and three of its four URLs
 * had rotted to routes that do not exist.
 *
 * The backend-only / build-time scenarios (scope projection idempotency, the
 * anti-pattern gate being clean, and the unresolved-scope fail-closed edge)
 * are excluded inline in the spec delta (`@e2e exclude ...`) per gate-19 and
 * are NOT duplicated here — they have no distinct UI flow and are unit/gate
 * covered.
 *
 * Anchors name the CANONICAL spec. They used to name
 * `openspec/changes/consume-or-rbac-authorization/...`, a path that stopped
 * existing when that change was archived, so none of them resolved. Only the
 * two admin-gating scenarios are anchored, because only that test runs. The
 * three skipped tests carry no anchor: their scenarios are excluded in the
 * canonical spec with the reason above, rather than counted as covered by a
 * test that never executes.
