 * Where the SPA's permission list comes from (decidiq#1267).
 *
 * The nav filter and the route guard both read one list, built in
 * `src/utils/permissions.js` from a single server-provided input: initial
 * state `isAdmin`, published by `DashboardController::renderIndex()` from
 * Nextcloud's own admin test on the acting user. Before #1267 the list was
 * derived from `window.OC.currentUser.permissions`, a property that does not
 * exist (OC.currentUser is the uid STRING), so the list was always `[]` and
 * the nav filter failed open for everyone.
 *
 * This spec asserts the half a browser can observe: what each account's page
 * load actually receives. How that value becomes a list, and how the guard
 * treats the list, is pinned in `tests/vitest/navPermissions.spec.js`; the
 * scenarios for those carry reason-bearing exclusions in the spec.
 *
 * WHY A REAL, NON-ADMIN ACCOUNT. The project's storage state is the `admin`
 * session, and admin is the one account for which the old fail-open bug and
 * a correct implementation look identical: both show everything. Only a
 * second account in no group at all can tell "the server said false" from
 * "nobody said anything". Every assertion names the account it is about.
 *
 * WHY A BROWSER LOGIN, NOT HTTP BASIC. The scenario is about what a person's
 * page load receives, so each account logs in through the login form in its
 * own context, exactly as the global setup does for admin.
