 * Who may write a Decision through OpenRegister's own object API (decidiq#1269).
 *
 * The Decision schema used to declare an `authorization` block naming `read`
 * and nothing else. OpenRegister resolves a schema's block IN PLACE OF the
 * register's (PermissionHandler::resolveAuthorizationRaw() only consults the
 * register when the schema block is empty), and a non-empty block denies every
 * action it omits (hasGroupPermission(): `if (empty($authorization[$action]))
 * return false;`). So the register's grant of `update` to the administrator
 * groups never reached Decision: a `decidiq-administrators` member got 403 on
 * every update, and nobody but a Nextcloud superuser could create one.
 *
 * WHY EVERY ACTOR HERE IS A REAL, NON-SUPERUSER ACCOUNT. A superuser bypasses
 * object RBAC AND property RBAC unconditionally, so a suite driven by the
 * `admin` session cannot tell "the rule holds" from "there is no rule". That is
 * how #1269 went unnoticed: every path an admin walks was healthy. The two
 * accounts below are created for this run, their groups are read back and
 * asserted before anything else, and every assertion message names the
 * account that acted.
 *
 * WHY THE FIXTURE IS OWNED BY SOMEONE ELSE. OpenRegister grants the object
 * owner every action before any rule is read. If the griffie account created
 * the Decision it edits, the edit would succeed whatever the schema said, so
 * the fixture is created by the admin account and its owner is asserted.
 *
 * WHY STEP 2 NEEDS STEP 1. #1271 put a property-level `update` rule on
 * `isPublished` / `publishedAt` naming a group with no members. A property rule
 * is only consulted AFTER the object-level update check passes, so while
 * #1269 stood, a refused `isPublished` write proved nothing: the object-level
 * deny refused it first, and it refused the title edit just the same. Step 1
 * shows the object-level check now admits the griffie account; step 2 then
 * requires the refusal to carry the PROPERTY rule's message, not the
 * object-level one. The two refusals are told apart by their text:
 *
 *   object level  : User '<name>' does not have permission to 'update' objects in schema 'Decision'
 *   property level: You are not authorized to modify the following properties: isPublished
 *
 * WHY PUT WITH THE WHOLE OBJECT. That is what the SPA sends
 * (@conduction/nextcloud-vue useObjectStore::saveObject() PUTs the object it
 * read). PATCH is avoided on purpose: OpenRegister's ObjectsController::patch()
 * has no NotAuthorizedException branch, so every refusal there comes back as a
 * bare 500 "Internal server error" and the two messages above are lost.
