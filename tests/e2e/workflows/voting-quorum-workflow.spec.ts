 * DEEP, data-dependent e2e — the decision/voting workflow with QUORUM and
 * TALLY correctness, plus the chair AUTHORIZATION guard.
 *
 * decidesk has a documented history of voting/quorum logic gaps
 * (isTransitionAllowed / validateQuorum defined-but-uncalled, fail-open auth
 * resolvers), so this spec exercises the state-change + quorum + tally paths
 * hard and asserts the *exact* computed outcomes — not just that pages render.
 *
 * It drives the REAL decidesk endpoints through Playwright's authenticated
 * request context (carries the admin session cookie + CSRF token):
 *   POST /api/voting-rounds            (open — chair-guarded, quorum-gated)
 *   POST /api/voting-rounds/{id}/cast  (cast a for/against/abstain vote)
 *   POST /api/voting-rounds/{id}/close (tally votes + drive motion lifecycle)
 *   POST /api/voting-rounds/{id}/tally (show-of-hands aggregate tally)
 * Fixtures are seeded via the OpenRegister object API (real verbs).
 *
 * ── DEPLOY REALITY (re-measured 2026-08-06 against CI run 31083903075) ────────
 * The older header here described "BUG-A" as decidesk filtering on
 * `relations.<schema>` where OpenRegister wanted `_relations.<schema>`. That
 * diagnosis was wrong in its second half, and the wrong half is why the tally
 * assertions kept failing after the "fix": the call sites HAD been changed to
 * `_relations.<schema-slug>`, and a slug-keyed filter still matches nothing.
 *
 * The real mechanism: decidesk writes links as a structured
 * `relations: [{register, schema, id}]` array, and OpenRegister's
 * SaveObject::scanForRelations() flattens that into the `_relations` JSONB keyed
 * by the PROPERTY PATH it walked — `relations.0.id` — never by the related
 * schema's slug. Its `_relations.<field>` filter resolves to
 * `kv.value = <id> AND (kv.key = '<field>' OR kv.key LIKE '<field>.%')`, so
 * `_relations.voting-round` cannot match a key named `relations.0.id`. Every
 * such query returned ZERO rows on a healthy HTTP 200, with nothing logged:
 * tallyResults saw no ballots and computed 0/0/0 = "invalid" no matter what was
 * cast. Fixed by keying the filter on `relations` (ObjectRelationFilter).
 *
 * "BUG-B" (saveShowOfHandsTally/castVote typed `: array` but returning an
 * ObjectEntity) is asserted directly by the last two tests below rather than
 * described here — if it regresses they go red on the 500.
